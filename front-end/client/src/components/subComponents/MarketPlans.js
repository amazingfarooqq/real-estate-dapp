          <h1>Marketing Your Home</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>We don’t simply put a sign in your yard and wait for others to sell. We know buyers form quick impressions when searching for properties online, so we always put our best foot forward with professional photos, articulate and vivid descriptions, and a variety of web and social media tools. Our team ensures your listing stands out and looks it’s best!</p>

          <h2> Staging</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>We will work with you to get your home ready to sell! At times, this takes de-cluttering, de-personalizing, and taking a step back to think like a buyer rather than an owner. If your home is in need of professional staging, we’re happy to make recommendations and point you in the right direction.</p>

          <h2> Professional Photos</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>We know that the majority of home searches start online, so if your home doesn’t look good on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, it won’t entice buyers to take a look in person. We’ll showcase your listing with crisp, high-resolution professional photography to grab and keep buyer attention. Having the right angles, shots, and editing go a long way in getting people through the doors of your home.</p>

          <h2> Virtual Tour</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>As technology evolves, we keep up with the trends. The virtual tour experience of showing a home to a buyer is priceless!</p>

          <h2> Open Houses</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>Not every agent takes the time to hold open houses, but we do! We’ll ensure your home is well-advertised and makes a great first impression. Our team also goes the extra mile to create ambiance with refreshments and snacks, soft music and plenty of light. Plus, each Open House includes the printing of financing brochures, documents pertaining to the house, and a color flyer for buyers to take home.</p>

          <h2>Internet</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>Your first showing is online! Our team will market your listing across large aggregate sites like Zillow and Trulia to ensure it is seen by as many browsers as possible. We also leverage targeted ads and our extensive social media network to engage with buyers and consumers about all our upcoming listings and open houses.</p>

          <h2>Email</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>We keep in contact with past and prospective clients, as well as other agents through our monthly email newsletter. That means your listing is delivered straight to the inboxes of our sphere and beyond! Every time we send a newsletter – we include buyer and seller resources, and helpful tips and tricks – so be sure to stay on our list!</p>

          <h2> Print</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>Print is a large part of our marketing strategy! When you list with us, we invest in printed, full color flyers as well as premier signage. Our signs are designed to stand out from the others and attract maximum attention to your listing. Plus, all signage includes a “Text option” so passersby can immediately receive pictures, video and info about your home!</p>

          <h2> MLS</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>As members of our MLS, your listing is automatically accessible to all other due-paying agents and brokers. The MLS website has access to all of the crucial information agents and homebuyers need such as private notes, the financing options you (the seller) will accept and more.</p>
